# android-Joystick-control-app-for-bluetooth-car-Kotlin

Bluetooth car control app for android, written in Kotlin.
It's just like any other bluetooth car app available on Playstore, but it has a joystick interface instead of button controls.
The app is only compatible with HC-05 BLE module.

Note: Icons don't belong to me.
