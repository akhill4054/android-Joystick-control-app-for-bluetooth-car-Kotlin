# android-Joystick-control-app-for-bluetooth-car-Kotlin

Bluetooth car control app for android, written in Kotlin.
It's just like any bluetooth car app available on Playstore, but it uses a joystick interface instead of button controls.
This app is only functional with HC-05 bluetooth module.

Note: Icon doesn't belong to me.
